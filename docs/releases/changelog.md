# Changelog

All notable changes to jGuard are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

#### Multi-Module Support
- Auto-discovery of policies embedded in signed JARs (`META-INF/jguard/policy.bin`)
- Per-module policy enforcement with module isolation
- Support for JPMS modular applications with multiple security domains
- `jguard.allowUnsignedPolicies` flag for development mode

#### External Policies with Grant/Deny
- External policy files for deployment-time customization
- `deny` statement to remove capabilities from embedded policies
- `deny(defensive)` to suppress warnings for intentional defensive denials
- `_global.jguard` for environment-wide restrictions (e.g., airgapped networks)
- Merge logic: `effective = (embedded ∪ external_grants ∪ global_grants) - (external_denials ∪ global_denials)`

#### Legacy Library Support
- External policies for third-party libraries without jGuard policies
- MODULE pattern matching for automatic modules (JAR-derived module names)
- Restrictive by default: unentitled operations are blocked

#### CLI Tools
- `jguardc` - Standalone compiler for `.jguard` policy files
- `jguard inspect` - Inspect policies in JARs or binary files
- `jguard list` - List all policies found in JARs on a path
- `jguard diff` - Compare two policy files
- `jguard validate-override` - Validate override policies

#### Policy Hot Reload
- Zero-downtime policy updates via file watching
- Configurable poll interval (`jguard.reload.interval`)
- Support for both explicit path and discovery mode
- External policy directory watching

#### Compiler Enhancements
- `--strict` flag treats warnings as errors (useful for CI)
- Redundant deny warnings when denying capabilities not in granted set
- Improved error messages with file:line:column format

### Changed

- Gradle plugin now configures tests to run on classpath (not module path) for JUnit/AssertJ compatibility
- Binary policy format version 2 includes denial support

### Fixed

- JPMS test isolation issue where test frameworks couldn't be found on module path

  - `native.load` - Native library loading
  - `env.read` - Environment variable access
  - `system.property.read` - System property reading
