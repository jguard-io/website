# Changelog

All notable changes to jGuard are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- **Test-specific policy overrides**: New `src/test/jguard/` directory support for test-only policies. Test policies extend embedded policies with additional permissions needed during testing (e.g., temp file access, thread creation). Policies are compiled by the `compileTestPolicies` task and automatically passed to the agent during test execution.
- **Multi-directory policy overrides**: The agent now supports comma-separated paths in `-Djguard.policy.override`, allowing layered policy overrides. Later directories take precedence.
- **Embedded external policies**: Modules can now ship policies for third-party dependencies by placing them in `src/main/jguard/`. These policies are compiled to `META-INF/jguard/external/*.bin` in the JAR and automatically discovered by the agent alongside embedded policies. This enables applications to define capabilities for runtime dependencies (e.g., Netty, Reactor) without requiring manual `-Djguard.policy.override` configuration. Same signing requirements apply as embedded policies.
- **Audit mode summary**: In audit mode, the agent now accumulates all unique denials and prints a summary at JVM shutdown. This shows all missing entitlements in one run instead of discovering them one-by-one.
- **Suggested policy output**: At shutdown in audit mode, the agent prints copy-paste-ready `.jguard` policy syntax based on observed denials. This dramatically speeds up initial policy authoring for new projects.
- **Policy discovery debug logging**: Added DEBUG-level logging for policy discovery from JARs and directories. Enable with `-Djguard.log.level=debug` to diagnose policy loading issues.

### Fixed

- **Gradle plugin configuration conflict**: Fixed `jguardAgent` configuration creation to use `maybeCreate()` instead of `create()`, avoiding conflicts when other plugins create the configuration first. This was blocking the per-module `module-info.jguard` workflow in multi-module builds.
- **Embedded policies not discovered during tests**: Fixed policy discovery for tests by outputting compiled policies to `build/jguard-policy/META-INF/jguard/` and registering this directory with `sourceSets.main.output.dir()`. This ensures policies are on the test classpath and properly packaged into JARs.
- **Gradle cross-project dependency ordering**: Fixed `compileJGuardPolicy` task lifecycle wiring. Policies now output to a dedicated `build/jguard-policy/` directory (avoiding conflicts with `compileJava`'s output), registered via `sourceSets.main.output.dir(builtBy: compileJGuardPolicy)`. This ensures cross-project dependencies (via `project(':other')`) automatically wait for policy compilation.
- **Directory-based policy discovery**: Fixed agent to discover embedded policies from directories on the classpath, not just JAR files. This enables policy discovery during development/testing when using Gradle class directories.
- **Gradle clean task**: The `clean` task now removes `build/jguard-policy/` and `build/test-policies/` directories, preventing stale compiled policy files from causing conflicts.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Classpath module resolution**: Fixed a bug where the presence of a `_global.jguard` file prevented package-prefix matching from working. Now per-module policies are correctly resolved on the classpath by matching caller packages against module names.
- **JDK internal native library loading**: Fixed crash when JDK loads native libraries (e.g., `extnet` for macOS sockets) with user code on the call stack. jGuard now detects when the immediate caller of `System.loadLibrary()` is JDK code and allows it without requiring user entitlements.
- **Windows non-default filesystem paths**: Fixed `InvalidPathException` on Windows when checking paths from non-default filesystem providers (e.g., ZipFS).

### Changed

- Classpath module resolution now tries package-prefix matching **before** falling back to the "unnamed" module policy from `_global.jguard`.
- `native.load` checks now allow JDK internal library loads (java.*, jdk.*, sun.*, com.sun.*) automatically.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

#### New Capabilities
- **`process.exec(pattern?)`** — Control process execution (`Runtime.exec()`, `ProcessBuilder.start()`)
  - Optional pattern argument to restrict allowed commands (e.g., `/usr/bin/java`, `/opt/app/bin/*`)
  - Prevents shell escapes and command injection attacks
- **`fs.hardlink(root, glob)`** — Control hard link creation (`Files.createLink()`)
  - Prevents filesystem boundary bypass attacks via hard links
  - Requires root directory and glob pattern arguments
- **`crypto.provider`** — Control JCE crypto provider modifications
  - Guards `Security.addProvider()`, `Security.insertProviderAt()`, `Security.removeProvider()`, `Security.setProperty()`
  - Prevents installation of rogue cryptographic providers
- **`runtime.exit`** — Control JVM termination (`System.exit()`, `Runtime.exit()`, `Runtime.halt()`)
  - Prevents rogue libraries from killing server applications
  - Critical for maintaining uptime SLAs
- **`runtime.shutdown_hook`** — Control shutdown hook registration (`Runtime.addShutdownHook()`, `Runtime.removeShutdownHook()`)
  - Prevents libraries from interfering with graceful shutdown

#### Trusted Module Mechanism
- `trusted;` keyword for modules that need unrestricted access (e.g., native ML libraries)
- Override-only: trusted keyword only allowed in external policy override files, not embedded policies
- Requires explicit opt-in via `-Djguard.allow.trusted=true` system property
- Security warning logged when trusted modules are loaded
- Gradle plugin `allowTrusted` configuration property

#### Gradle Plugin Improvements
- Automatic incremental builds for `compileExternalPolicies` task with proper file change detection
- Test tasks automatically depend on `compileExternalPolicies` when external policies are configured
- Global policies (`_global.jguard`) now apply to unnamed module (classpath code)

#### Agent Improvements
- Bootstrap JAR caching with content-hash based invalidation
  - Configurable cache directory via `jguard.bootstrap.cache.dir` system property
  - Automatic cache invalidation when agent JAR changes (including SNAPSHOT builds)
- AUDIT mode now respects explicit `jguard.log.allowed=false` setting
- Contextual keywords: all keywords (`security`, `module`, `entitle`, `deny`, `to`, `trusted`) are now contextual, allowing package names like `io.example.security.module`

### Changed

- Binary policy format version bumped to v3 (supports trusted flag)
- Bootstrap cache filename includes content hash for reliable cache invalidation

### Fixed

- `jguard.log.allowed=false` now properly suppresses ALLOWED logs in AUDIT mode
- `compileExternalPolicies` task now correctly detects file content changes
- Bootstrap JAR cache no longer uses stale cached versions after rebuilds

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

#### Multi-Module Support
- Auto-discovery of policies embedded in signed JARs (`META-INF/jguard/policy.bin`)
- Per-module policy enforcement with module isolation
- Support for JPMS modular applications with multiple security domains
- `jguard.allowUnsignedPolicies` flag for development mode

#### External Policies with Grant/Deny
- External policy files for deployment-time customization
- `deny` statement to remove capabilities from embedded policies
- `deny(defensive)` to suppress warnings for intentional defensive denials
- `_global.jguard` for environment-wide restrictions (e.g., airgapped networks)
- Merge logic: `effective = (embedded ∪ external_grants ∪ global_grants) - (external_denials ∪ global_denials)`

#### Legacy Library Support
- External policies for third-party libraries without jGuard policies
- MODULE pattern matching for automatic modules (JAR-derived module names)
- Restrictive by default: unentitled operations are blocked

#### CLI Tools
- `jguardc` - Standalone compiler for `.jguard` policy files
- `jguard inspect` - Inspect policies in JARs or binary files
- `jguard list` - List all policies found in JARs on a path
- `jguard diff` - Compare two policy files
- `jguard validate-override` - Validate override policies

#### Policy Hot Reload
- Zero-downtime policy updates via file watching
- Configurable poll interval (`jguard.reload.interval`)
- Support for both explicit path and discovery mode
- External policy directory watching

#### Compiler Enhancements
- `--strict` flag treats warnings as errors (useful for CI)
- Redundant deny warnings when denying capabilities not in granted set
- Improved error messages with file:line:column format

### Changed

- Gradle plugin now configures tests to run on classpath (not module path) for JUnit/AssertJ compatibility
- Binary policy format version 2 includes denial support

### Fixed

- JPMS test isolation issue where test frameworks couldn't be found on module path
